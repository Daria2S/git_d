I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe

Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through, through it this time
Girl just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through
